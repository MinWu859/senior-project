                    <p>The pie chart above shows that only 15.2% of the total responses think that
                        the period products are affordable. However, the largest percentage of 64.4
                        percent perceive the period products they use to be somewhat affordable.
                        This is a clear indication that majority of Penn State students feel that
                        the products they use cost more than they should.</p>

                    <p>From the plot, Erie Campus has the majority of responses and majority of the
                        individuals from most of the campuses perceive the period products they use
                        to be somewhat affordable. A bigger percentage of students from Beaver and
                        York perceive the period products to be expensive. This should raise an
                        alert to investigate the products being used in these two campuses and also
                        ascertain that they are priced right. Very few individuals feel that their
                        period products are very affordable.</p>

                    <p>The campuses in the West have the most responses where majority of the
                        students think that the period products they use are somewhat affordable,
                        with the least percentage perceiving them to be affordable. From this, it is
                        right to assume that something should be done to introduce subsidies on
                        period products so that they can be easily affordable to all Penn State
                        students.</p>

                    <p>Majority of the students have experienced period stigma. Majority of them
                        perceive period products to be somewhat affordable while the minority of
                        them perceive period products to be affordable. Taking a look at the ones
                        who have never experienced period stigma, the least proportion of these
                        individuals are the one who perceive period products to be expensive. This
                        is a clear indication that the price of period products should be lowered
                        and made affordable for all and reduce period stigmatization.</p>
