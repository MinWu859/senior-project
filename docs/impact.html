                    <p>Beaver Campus has the majority number of students who are not concerned about
                        the environmental impact of period products, followed by New Kensington, the
                        rest of the campuses are trailing in the category where students are not
                        concerned about the environmental impact of period products. There should be
                        more awareness campaigns organized in Beaver, New Kensington and York to
                        ensure that the students are aware of the impact period products have on the
                        environment.</p>

                    <p>The plot above shows that the primary concern when choosing period products
                        for the majority of the students who seeks eco-friendly options is having
                        leakage protection. On the other hand, for the students who are not seeking
                        eco-friendly options, their primary concern is ease of use of the period
                        products. This shows the difference in the primary concern of period
                        products of the two groups of students.</p>
