                    <p>The bar plot above shows that most students prefer to use disposable pads,
                        followed by tampons as the preferred period product. However, menstrual cups
                        and period underwear are trailing with reusable cloth pads having the least
                        users at almost 0%. This is a clear indication that most people have not
                        embraced the use of reusable period products such as the reusable cloth pads
                        which are environmentally friendly. </p>

                    <p>From the plot above, the responses show that most students seek comfort,
                        affordability and availability in the period products that they use. These
                        are factors that are likely to lead to stigmatization in case the product
                        they use does not provide the quality they seek for. </p>

                    <p>The primary concern of the students in period products is having products
                        that provide leakage protection. Additionally, have products that are
                        comfortable and are affordable. Emphasis of environmental impact of period
                        products should be raised in all campuses to ensure that all individuals are
                        aware of the effects period products have on the environment.</p>

                    <p>Having a variety of products on campus is considered very important by more
                        two thirds of the total responders. As a result, all campuses should ensure
                        that they provide a variety of period products on campus to ensure that all
                        individuals have the product of their choice. This will improve the
                        confidence and eliminate period stigma.</p>

                    <p>In the products used by all students, majority reported that they do not
                        experience any allergic reactions. Very few have reported varying allergic
                        reactions for disposable pads, tampons and menstrual cups. This is a good
                        thing because most individuals can use period products without getting
                        effects that affect their comfort and health.</p>

                    <p>In the plot above, the majority of period products used are disposable pads
                        and tampons. Erie and Beaver campuses have the majority of users using these
                        common products. There is a significant difference in the number of users in
                        the other products. </p>
