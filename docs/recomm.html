                    <p>Majority of the students who responded seems to be satisfied with their
                        current period product because they are likely and somewhat likely to
                        recommend the current product they use. Only a small portion of 12%
                        responded that they would not recommend their current product to others. The
                        goal should be to ensure that the products used meets the primary concern
                        and it can be easily recommended to others</p>

                    <p>For the majority of students, they have been victims of period
                        stigmatization. The largest portion of them are likely to recommend the
                        period products they use to other students. The smallest portion of the
                        individuals who have experienced period stigma are not likely to recommend
                        the products they use. In all categories of the responses of whether the
                        individuals have experienced period stigma or not, the least portion of the
                        individuals are not likely to recommend their products of use.</p>

                    <p>In majority of the products used as shown by the plot above, most students
                        would actually recommend them. Very few of them would not recommend the
                        current product they use to other students. This is shows that most
                        individuals get the value they are seeking in period products they use and
                        they would recommend them. Most of the students tend to use disposable pads
                        and tampons and these two products are most likely to be recommended by
                        students.</p>
