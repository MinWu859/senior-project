                    <p>According to this graph, over half of the students encountered period stigma.
                        And only around 20% of them are pretty sure that they never encountered.
                        This data can tell that period stigma can be a serious problems for all
                        college students and all women, most of the women have period stigma
                        problems and the society need to find a way to resolve that.</p>

                <div class="text">
                    <p>According to this graph, most of the students who answer "yes" and "maybe" to
                        "interested in learning about reusable products", a large portion of them
                        have experienced period stigma. That may point out that the period sigma may
                        cause by the inconvenience of the period products. By using reusable
                        products, people can wear the pad without getting undressed in public
                        restroom, and it is also easy to wash. Most students are interested in
                        learning reusable products maybe because the disposable products have some
                        disadvantages like hard to wash the unexpected blood on the underwear. This
                        would probably be the reason of why they have encountered stigma. However
                        reusable products are more convenient to use and can solve that kind of
                        problem.</p>

                    <p>According to this graph, most of the students who have allergies to products
                        have experienced period stigma. The products' allergic reactions may also be
                        one of the reasons that cause stigma. From the graph, "rash" and "specific
                        product's brand" are the two main reasons for allergies. I think if the period
                        products' companies can provide more high-quality products to avoid these
                        allergic reations, women's physical and psychological health can be much
                        improved, and the period stigma problems can also be reduced. </p>

                    <p>According to this graph, most of the students who think it's very important
                        to have variety products' choices, a large portion of them have experienced
                        period stigma. This data result may in some way imply that the lack of the
                        products' type on campus can be one of the reasons that cause period stigma.
                        And providing more types of period products in campus' restrooms may reduce
                        people's period stigma. It's necessary for all Penn State campuses to
                        provide a variety of period products in order to bring convenience to
                        students and to relieve students' period stigma. Different students may like
                        to use different types of products, and if they can't find the specific type
                        that they want when the urgent situation comes, they may feel embarrassed
                        (stigma). So it's essential for the school to increase products' variety to
                        avoid this kind of circumstance.</p>
