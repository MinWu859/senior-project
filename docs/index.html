            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>For my senior project, I'm studying and researching the topic about menstruation
                products. In the summer of 2023, I accidentally opened the TikTok platform and read a
                story about a poor Chinese girl who died of cancer from using substandard tampons.
                She had no money and chose poor quality sanitary napkins, which caused her body to
                suffer serious damage. I was shocked and saddened, So I wanted to investigate the
                affordability and choice of menstrual products among American college students
                through the population of PSU college students, whether there are any psychological
                barriers to menstrual products, whether there are any allergies to menstrual
                products, and how they understand the relationship between menstrual products and
                environmental protection.</p>
            <p>In order to accomplish this research project, I created a Google survey for all PSU
                college students and distributed it to different campuses through flyers and emails.
                After collecting all of the questionnaires, I will use the data to analyze the
                impact of menstrual products on college students, the specific perceptions of
                college students towards menstrual products, and what changes society and companies
                should make to let menstruation more convenient for women. Finally, I will use the
                data to create a chart for each question in the questionnaire so that the readers
                can visualize the data and the social issues that are hidden underneath those
                data.</p>
            <p>I hope to use this project to enhance our understanding of the relationship between
                menstrual products and women; to use survey data to delve deeper into society's
                systems or limitations for women, and to solve any problems within menstrual
                products through practical action. Here is my Google survey link: <a

            <p>Here are some links to resources on period products and period stigma. You can use
                the information in these links to get an initial idea about menstrual products and
                period stigma, and I think it's essential for readers to know something about
                menstrual products as well.</p>
