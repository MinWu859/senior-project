            <h1>Period products, Personal health and the Environment</h1>
        </section>
        <div class="evalcontainer">
            <div class="paragraphs">
                <p> When it comes to selecting period products that are healthy for both you and the
                    environment, it's essential to consider their environmental impact and potential
                    health risks. Disposable pads and tampons, while commonly used, have a
                    significant negative impact on the environment. They contribute to excessive
                    waste in landfills, taking hundreds of years to decompose. Additionally, the
                    manufacturing process involves harmful chemicals and resource-intensive
                    production methods. While some organic pads and tampons are compostable, they
                    still take a considerable amount of time to break down. Reusable pads, on the
                    other hand, offer a more sustainable option, lasting for several years and
                    reducing waste, but they require regular washing, which may not be feasible in
                    areas with limited access to water and sanitation.</p>
                <p>Tampons, especially those with plastic applicators, are among the worst offenders
                    in terms of environmental impact. They contain a significant amount of plastic
                    and often end up polluting oceans and beaches. Reusable tampon applicators can
                    be used to reduce single-use plastic consumption. Organic tampons made of
                    natural materials like cotton or bamboo are compostable and can help minimize
                    environmental harm. However, it's important to consider the water and pesticide
                    use associated with non-organic cotton production. </p>
                <p>Menstrual cups stand out as the most environmentally friendly option, with
                    minimal environmental impact. They can be used for several years, significantly
                    reducing the number of disposable products used over a lifetime. Despite
                    misconceptions and stigma, menstrual cups are safe and made from materials that
                    are not harmful to the environment. Silicone, a common material used in
                    menstrual cups, degrades into a harmless state, and its production has a
                    relatively low environmental impact.</p>
                <p> Lastly, period underwear offers a reusable alternative that is less wasteful
                    than disposable products. However, like reusable pads, they require access to
                    water and sanitation, which can be a challenge for some individuals.
                    Additionally, multiple pairs may be needed per cycle, making them less
                    economical than some other options.</p>

                <p>Issues with testing menstrual and period products, as well as access to these
                    essential items, present significant challenges that have been further
                    exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The phenomenon of "period poverty"
                    highlights inadequate access to menstrual hygiene tools and education, impacting
                    individuals' ability to afford these products. In many parts of the world,
                    including the United States, misconceptions about menstruation contribute to
                    social stigmatization, limiting access to education and career advancement. The
                    cost of tampons and pads over a lifetime can be substantial, leaving women in
                    vulnerable situations to resort to makeshift sanitation products, which can lead
                    to severe health conditions. Despite their importance, menstrual hygiene
                    products are not classified as essential, making them ineligible for federal
                    food stamp programs and tax exemptions during public health crises like
                    COVID-19, leaving individuals with the difficult choice of purchasing these
                    products or providing for their families.</p>
                <p>The stigma surrounding menstruation further complicates the issue, discouraging
                    open dialogue about access to products, taxation, and product safety. Advocates
                    like Reilly Bealer, a medical student, emphasize the need to normalize periods
                    as a natural physiological process and not a taboo topic. Efforts are underway
                    to advocate for better access to menstrual products, with some states
                    implementing legislation to provide free products in public school restrooms.
                    However, on a federal level, progress has been limited, and awareness among
                    legislators varies. To address this issue comprehensively, education about
                    period poverty is crucial, along with initiatives like menstrual hygiene product
                    drives to support vulnerable communities while challenging the societal stigma
                    associated with menstruation.</p>
                <p>Society's knowledge of menstruation is lacking in some areas.
                    In recent social news, some women have stated that people have been using water
                    to test the leak-proofness of menstrual products until 2023, when blood will be
                    used for the first time to test. Every woman
                    knows that the consistency of water and the nature of the liquid are not
                    comparable to menstruation, which suggests that there is little focus on
                    menstruation.</p>

        </section>
        <div class="evalcontainer">
            <div class="paragraphs">
                <p>Bad period products around the world exacerbate serious health issues for women
                    and menstruators, particularly those facing period poverty. Period poverty,
                    characterized by the inability to afford sanitary products, forces individuals
                    to resort to unhygienic alternatives like rags, paper towels, or cardboard. This
                    not only strips them of dignity but also exposes them to various health risks,
                    including urogenital infections such as urinary tract infections and bacterial
                    vaginosis. Moreover, the emotional toll of inadequate access to menstrual
                    products can lead to poor mental health outcomes, including increased anxiety,
                    depression, and distress. This crisis is further exacerbated by the stigma
                    associated with menstruation, hindering discussions about access to products,
                    taxation on menstrual items, and even the ingredients in sanitary products. It's
                    crucial to recognize that not all menstruators are women, and addressing this
                    issue requires breaking down these stigmas and ensuring menstrual products are
                    accessible, safe, and destigmatized for all.</p>
                <p>Period poverty disproportionately affects low-income menstruators, as products
                    are ineligible for coverage under food stamps and SNAP benefits. This leaves
                    individuals with the difficult choice between purchasing menstrual products or
                    providing other essentials for their families. Consequently, inadequate
                    menstrual management can hinder educational and employment opportunities,
                    perpetuating the cycle of poverty. To combat this crisis, efforts toward
                    menstrual equity are essential, including advocating for free products in
                    schools, raising awareness on social media, and organizing donation drives.
                    Achieving menstrual equity, where period products are accessible, safe, and
                    destigmatized, is not only a right but also a necessity for the well-being of
                    individuals worldwide.</p>
