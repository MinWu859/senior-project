            <h1>Period Products Evaluation</h1>
            <p>I will review most of the period products available on the market, and I will also
                evaluate each product's health, leakage protection rating, as well as its price
                point. My goal is to help more women who want to choose period products that work
                better for them.(Star rating from bad to good).</p>

        <p>&#9672 Some disposable pads may include irritating chemicals or perfumes.
                However, there are several brands that provide organic or chemical-free
                alternatives.</p>
        <p>&#9672 Generally provides good protection, but effectiveness can vary by brand
                and individual fit.</p>
        <p>&#9672 Middle of the road in terms of cost, with prices varying by brand $3 -
                $10 per pack.</p><br>
        <p>• Materials: Synthetic fibers (polyethylene, polypropylene), bleached cotton,
                and absorbent chemicals (such SAP - Super Absorbent Polymer) are often used in the
                production of disposable pads.<br>
        • Bleaching Agents: Chlorine bleaching is used on certain disposable pads'
                cotton and other materials. Dioxins, a kind of unsafe and persistent organic
                pollutant, may be produced in very small quantities during this
            procedure.<br>
        • Fragrances and Dyes: Some people may have skin irritation or an allergic
                response to the scents and colors used in disposable pads. While not necessarily
                unsafe, some additives may cause issues for persons with sensitivity.</p><br>
        <p>• Concern: Some people may have skin irritation or an allergic response after
                using disposable pads since they include scents and colors, and trace levels of
                dioxins from the bleaching process. There is new evidence that suggests certain
                disposable pads may contain PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl compounds), often known
                as "forever chemicals." Reduced fertility, hormone instability, and an increased
                risk of cancer are just some of the health problems that have been connected to PFAS
                (Kluger, 2023). Disposable pads provide a health risk because of the proximity of
                their chemicals to women's skin.</p><br>

        <p>&#9672 Produced from a medical-grade elastomer, rubber, silicone, or latex. Zero
                chemicals. Effective usage reduces the potential for toxic shock syndrome
                (TSS).</p>
        <p>&#9672 When inserted correctly, offers excellent protection for many
            hours.</p>
        <p>&#9672 Though more expensive initially, its extended lifespan and repeated use
                make it a good investment. Costs between $20 and $40 per, but lasts for
            years.</p><br>
        <p>• Materials: Silicone, latex, rubber, or elastomer of medical grade quality are
                common materials for menstrual cups.<br>
        • Latex: Some menstruation cups are made with latex, which might trigger an
                allergic response in those who are sensitive to or allergic to the material. Most
                contemporary menstruation cups are crafted from medical-grade silicone, which is
                safe and hypoallergenic for most users.<br>
        • Cleaning Agents: Menstrual cups must be cleaned thoroughly after each use to
                ensure cleanliness. Some people utilize strong cleaning chemicals that aren't safe
                for internal use. When sterilizing, it's best to use either a moderate, non-toxic
                cleaning or hot water.</p><br>
        <p>• Concern: Menstrual cups are typically safe, although those with latex or
                silicone sensitivity should use caution. Avoid complications by always
                using a high-quality medical-grade cup.</p><br>

        <p>&#9672 Risk of TSS, especially if left in too long. Some may contain chemicals
                or fragrances.</p>
        <p>&#9672 Offers good protection, but effectiveness can vary by absorbency and
                individual fit.</p>
        <p>&#9672 Cost about the same as single-use pads. Over time, expenses may mount.
                The cost ranges from $5 to $10 each box (wherein you can normally find 18 to 36
                tampons).</p><br>
       <p>• Materials: Tampons may include synthetic elements like scents and colours in
                addition to natural materials like cotton, rayon, or a combination of the
            two.<br>
        • Rayon and Dioxins: Like disposable pads, tampons produced from rayon may be
                bleached, which may produce low levels of dioxins. Dioxin exposure has been reduced
                because to greater limitations and higher industry standards.<br>
        • Fragrances and Dyes: Like disposable pads, tampons can also contain fragrances
                and dyes that might lead to skin irritation or allergic reactions.</p><br>
        <p>• Concern: Dioxins are produced in very small quantities when rayon is bleached
                with chlorine. Some people are also allergic to or experience discomfort from scents
                and colours.</p><br>

        <p>&#9672 Typically made of breathable fabric. No chemicals or
            fragrances.</p>
        <p>&#9672 Offers good protection, especially when combined with another period
                product.</p>
        <p>&#9672 Reusable goods have a higher initial investment compared to disposable
                ones, but they may save money in the long run. 20-50 USD each pair (reusable and
                washable).</p><br>
        <p>• Materials: Moisture-wicking fabrics, absorbent layers (often a cotton and
                synthetic blend), and a waterproof layer all go into making up a set of period
                underwear.<br>
       • Synthetic Absorbent Layers: Absorbent layers in certain kinds of menstrual
                underwear are made of synthetic materials, which may retain moisture and foster the
                development of germs. This may cause irritation or an unpleasant odor, but it is not
                always harmful.<br>
        • Waterproof Layer: PUL (Polyurethane Laminate) is a synthetic material often
                used for the waterproof layer in period underwear. Despite widespread assurances of
                PUL's safety, others worry about the toll it may have on the natural
            world.</p><br>
        <p>• Concern: Some people worry that the synthetic materials used in the absorbent
                layers of period underwear might cause bacterial overgrowth or make you feel
                uncomfortable because of the trapped moisture. Nonetheless, many manufacturers place
                a premium on employing non-toxic, permeable fabrics. A class action lawsuit against
                Thinx, a brand of period pants, was recently resolved after allegations surfaced
                that the goods contained PFAS and other dangerous chemicals. Plaintiffs alleged that
                Thinx's advertising of its goods as safe and devoid of hazardous ingredients was
                fraudulent. Although it admitted no wrongdoing, as part of the settlement Thinx will
                pay up to $5 million in restitution and alter its manufacturing and advertising
                procedures (Treisman, 2023). The focus of the complaint was on Thinx's advertising,
                not the safety of the product itself.</p><br>

            hemp.<br>
        • Waterproof Layer: Some fabric pads, much like some brands of period underwear,
                have a PUL or similar synthetic waterproof covering. PUL's viability as a safety
                material is dependent.</p><br>
       <p>• Concern: There is less cause for alarm while using cloth pads since they are
                not treated with hazardous chemicals. PUL, a synthetic material, may be included in
                the waterproof layer (Menstrual Care Products and toxic chemicals,

            <div class="paragraphs">
                <p> When it comes to selecting period products that are healthy for both you and the
                    environment, it's essential to consider their environmental impact and potential
                    health risks. Disposable pads and tampons, while commonly used, have a
                    significant negative impact on the environment. They contribute to excessive
                    waste in landfills, taking hundreds of years to decompose. Additionally, the
                    manufacturing process involves harmful chemicals and resource-intensive
                    production methods. While some organic pads and tampons are compostable, they
                    still take a considerable amount of time to break down. Reusable pads, on the
                    other hand, offer a more sustainable option, lasting for several years and
                    reducing waste, but they require regular washing, which may not be feasible in
                    areas with limited access to water and sanitation.</p>
                <p>Tampons, especially those with plastic applicators, are among the worst offenders
                    in terms of environmental impact. They contain a significant amount of plastic
                    and often end up polluting oceans and beaches. Reusable tampon applicators can
                    be used to reduce single-use plastic consumption. Organic tampons made of
                    natural materials like cotton or bamboo are compostable and can help minimize
                    environmental harm. However, it's important to consider the water and pesticide
                    use associated with non-organic cotton production. </p>
                <p>Menstrual cups stand out as the most environmentally friendly option, with
                    minimal environmental impact. They can be used for several years, significantly
                    reducing the number of disposable products used over a lifetime. Despite
                    misconceptions and stigma, menstrual cups are safe and made from materials that
                    are not harmful to the environment. Silicone, a common material used in
                    menstrual cups, degrades into a harmless state, and its production has a
                    relatively low environmental impact.</p>
                <p> Lastly, period underwear offers a reusable alternative that is less wasteful
                    than disposable products. However, like reusable pads, they require access to
                    water and sanitation, which can be a challenge for some individuals.
                    Additionally, multiple pairs may be needed per cycle, making them less
                    economical than some other options.</p>

                <p>Issues with testing menstrual and period products, as well as access to these
                    essential items, present significant challenges that have been further
                    exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The phenomenon of "period poverty"
                    highlights inadequate access to menstrual hygiene tools and education, impacting
                    individuals' ability to afford these products. In many parts of the world,
                    including the United States, misconceptions about menstruation contribute to
                    social stigmatization, limiting access to education and career advancement. The
                    cost of tampons and pads over a lifetime can be substantial, leaving women in
                    vulnerable situations to resort to makeshift sanitation products, which can lead
                    to severe health conditions. Despite their importance, menstrual hygiene
                    products are not classified as essential, making them ineligible for federal
                    food stamp programs and tax exemptions during public health crises like
                    COVID-19, leaving individuals with the difficult choice of purchasing these
                    products or providing for their families.</p>
                <p>The stigma surrounding menstruation further complicates the issue, discouraging
                    open dialogue about access to products, taxation, and product safety. Advocates
                    like Reilly Bealer, a medical student, emphasize the need to normalize periods
                    as a natural physiological process and not a taboo topic. Efforts are underway
                    to advocate for better access to menstrual products, with some states
                    implementing legislation to provide free products in public school restrooms.
                    However, on a federal level, progress has been limited, and awareness among
                    legislators varies. To address this issue comprehensively, education about
                    period poverty is crucial, along with initiatives like menstrual hygiene product
                    drives to support vulnerable communities while challenging the societal stigma
                    associated with menstruation.</p>
                <p>Society's knowledge of menstruation is lacking in some areas. In recent social
                    news, some women have stated that people have been using water to test the
                    leak-proofness of menstrual products until 2023, when blood will be used for the
                    first time to test. Every woman knows that the consistency of water and the
                    nature of the liquid are not comparable to menstruation, which suggests that
                    there is little focus on menstruation.</p>

                <p>Bad period products around the world exacerbate serious health issues for women
                    and menstruators, particularly those facing period poverty. Period poverty,
                    characterized by the inability to afford sanitary products, forces individuals
                    to resort to unhygienic alternatives like rags, paper towels, or cardboard. This
                    not only strips them of dignity but also exposes them to various health risks,
                    including urogenital infections such as urinary tract infections and bacterial
                    vaginosis. Moreover, the emotional toll of inadequate access to menstrual
                    products can lead to poor mental health outcomes, including increased anxiety,
                    depression, and distress. This crisis is further exacerbated by the stigma
                    associated with menstruation, hindering discussions about access to products,
                    taxation on menstrual items, and even the ingredients in sanitary products. It's
                    crucial to recognize that not all menstruators are women, and addressing this
                    issue requires breaking down these stigmas and ensuring menstrual products are
                    accessible, safe, and destigmatized for all.</p>
                <p>Period poverty disproportionately affects low-income menstruators, as products
                    are ineligible for coverage under food stamps and SNAP benefits. This leaves
                    individuals with the difficult choice between purchasing menstrual products or
                    providing other essentials for their families. Consequently, inadequate
                    menstrual management can hinder educational and employment opportunities,
                    perpetuating the cycle of poverty. To combat this crisis, efforts toward
                    menstrual equity are essential, including advocating for free products in
                    schools, raising awareness on social media, and organizing donation drives.
                    Achieving menstrual equity, where period products are accessible, safe, and
                    destigmatized, is not only a right but also a necessity for the well-being of
                    individuals worldwide.</p>
