                    <p>In the 19th century, the concept of cleanliness underwent a profound
                        transformation in Euro-American society. Bathing was a rare occurrence, and
                        hygiene practices were minimal. However, as we delve into this historical shift,
                        it becomes evident that these changes were not merely a matter of personal
                        hygiene. Instead, they were deeply entangled with evolving notions of race,
                        gender, and power dynamics.</p>
                    <p>During the 19th century, gynecology was emerging as a field, but it carried with
                        it horrific experiments on Black women, who were often subjected to medical
                        procedures without anesthesia. Menstruation was framed as a disease,
                        perpetuating the idea that women were unclean and diseased for a significant
                        portion of each month. This notion of uncleanliness further marginalized women
                        from active participation in society, reinforcing gender hierarchies. </p>
                    <p>Furthermore, the cleanliness of white women was presented as a sign of
                        civilization and white supremacy. Soap companies capitalized on this idea by
                        manufacturing products like vaginal deodorants and douches, reinforcing the myth
                        that women needed these products to maintain their cleanliness and social
                        status. This era also saw the emergence of strict gender norms, where white
                        women were encouraged to avoid outdoor work, further solidifying the idea that
                        appearing clean was as important as being clean. </p>
                    <p> The settler colonial project was underpinned by a narrative that portrayed
                        Indigenous peoples as dirty or vermin. This dehumanization allowed for the
                        violent practices of Indigenous removal and relocation to be justified,
                        effectively laying the groundwork for ethnic cleansing. Genocidal boarding
                        schools further propagated the idea of cleanliness, using it as a tool for
                        forced assimilation. By framing Indigenous children as dirty and in need of
                        cleansing, these schools sought to erase Indigenous cultures and languages.</p>
                    <p>The fear and disgust associated with those constructed as "dirty" continue to
                        manifest today. Asian-Americans, for example, have been scapegoated for the
                        spread of diseases such as cholera in the 19th century and COVID-19 in the 21st
                        century. These racialized narratives have led to discriminatory policies and
                        violence against Asian-Americans, particularly women and girls. Moreover, some
                        contemporary cleanliness practices, like the use of douches and vaginal
                        deodorants, can be harmful to women's health. These products disrupt the natural
                        pH balance of the vagina, increasing the risk of infections and other health
                        issues. Alarmingly, these practices disproportionately affect Black and Hispanic
                        women and women from low-income backgrounds. </p>
