            <h1>History</h1>
            <p>The histories of monthly cycle and menstrual care are regularly ignored, in spite of
                nearly 50% of the world's populace encountering periods at a few point in their
                lives. The utilize of menstrual care items goes back centuries: in old Greece, build
                up wrapped around wood was utilized as a tampon, and greenery as well as buffalo
                skin were utilized as cushions by Local Americans. Within the 18th and 19th
                centuries, ladies in Europe utilized woven fabric or wool to create hand crafted
                cloth cushions. These might be washed and re-used, illustrating a more feasible and
                prudent alternative, but still distant less sterile than the arrangements numerous
                are usual to nowadays.</p>
            <p>Feminine cycle has frequently been considered unthinkable in Western social orders.
                In any case, old Egyptian therapeutic writings, for illustration, state that
                menstrual blood can be utilized in ointments for wellbeing medications. On the other
                hand, the primary Latin reference book from 73 Advertisement expressed: "to taste it
                drives pooches frantic and contaminates their nibbles with an serious harm". Within
                the 19th century, negative affiliations with monthly cycle were propogated broadly,
                indeed by therapeutic experts. An 1811 distribution titled, The Standards of
                Birthing assistance, composed by Dr John Burns, states that feminine cycle is "to be
                considered a malady". Such shame contrarily affected the lives of ladies, and
                implied that menstrual items may not effectively be advertised. Women were hesitant
                to be seen acquiring items with negative essences, and as a result, the primary
                commercially accessible menstrual items were monetarily unsuccessful.</p>

                            Crusade:blog.apaonline.org/</h4></center>
                    <p>In the 19th century, the concept of cleanliness underwent a profound
                        transformation in Euro-American society. Bathing was a rare occurrence, and
                        hygiene practices were minimal. However, as we delve into this historical
                        shift, it becomes evident that these changes were not merely a matter of
                        personal hygiene. Instead, they were deeply entangled with evolving notions
                        of race, gender, and power dynamics.</p>
                    <p>During the 19th century, gynecology was emerging as a field, but it carried
                        with it horrific experiments on Black women, who were often subjected to
                        medical procedures without anesthesia. Menstruation was framed as a disease,
                        perpetuating the idea that women were unclean and diseased for a significant
                        portion of each month. This notion of uncleanliness further marginalized
                        women from active participation in society, reinforcing gender hierarchies. </p>
                    <p>Furthermore, the cleanliness of white women was presented as a sign of
                        civilization and white supremacy. Soap companies capitalized on this idea by
                        manufacturing products like vaginal deodorants and douches, reinforcing the
                        myth that women needed these products to maintain their cleanliness and
                        social status. This era also saw the emergence of strict gender norms, where
                        white women were encouraged to avoid outdoor work, further solidifying the
                        idea that appearing clean was as important as being clean. </p>
