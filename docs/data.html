                <h1>Data visualization and analysis</h1>
                <p>In this section, I will analyze the data obtained from questionnaire and create
                    several statistical graphs. These graphs will help you visualize the data and
                    analyze the problems. I have divided all the charts into several modules by
                    contents to make it easier for you to read them.

                    <h3>Period Stigma</h3>
                    <p>Period stigma refers to the social stigma and cultural taboos surrounding
                        menstruation. Despite being a normal and healthy part of life, menstruation
                        has been historically associated with shame, embarrassment, and cultural
                        restrictions in many societies. In this section, I will make some graphs
                        about how period stigma related with indivituals interests, products
                        affordability, and more.</p>

                <div class="sep">
                    <h3>Products Affordability</h3>
                    <p>Menstrual product affordability refers to the accessibility and financial
                        feasibility of menstrual hygiene products for individuals who menstruate.
                        Menstrual products, such as pads, tampons, menstrual cups, and others, are
                        essential for managing menstruation in a safe and hygienic manner. However,
                        the cost of these products can be a significant barrier for some
                        individuals, leading to challenges in maintaining menstrual health and
                        hygiene. In this section, I will make some graphs about how product
                        affordability counts by different regions of Pennsylvania and Penn State
                        campuses, and how it related to people who have experienced period stigma. </p>

                    <h3>Products Environment Impact</h3>
                    <p>The environmental impact of menstrual products is a topic of growing concern
                        due to the widespread use of disposable products and their contribution to
                        waste. In this section, I will make some graphs about comparing the
                        Proportions of Responses by campus in concerned and not concerned categories
                        of current products' environmental impact; And how the products' environmental impact factors influence students' choice of
                        period products, etc. </p>

                    <h3>Products Recommendation</h3>
                    <p>Some students at school would be willing to introduce the menstrual products
                        they are using to their classmates or friends. In this section, I will make
                        some graphs about how products recommendation related to students who have
                        experienced period stigma and the proportions of how likely are students to
                        recommend their preferred period products to other students.</p>

                    <h3>Products Used</h3>
                    <p>Period products are items designed to absorb or collect menstrual blood and
                        provide comfort and hygiene. The individuals can choose different types of
                        menstrual products based on their preferences, comfort, lifestyle, and
                        health considerations. In this section, I will make some graphs about
                        different type of period products that Penn State students used; what
                        factors influences their products' choices; how products' choices related to
                        allergic reactions, and more.</p>
